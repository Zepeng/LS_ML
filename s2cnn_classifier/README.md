# Event classifier using spherical CNN
This event classifier is based on [s2cnn](https://github.com/jonas-koehler/s2cnn). This package is similar to cnn_classifier, but uses a different data format and network.
We use SPHERICAL CNNS ON UNSTRUCTURED GRIDS here to do the classification(refer to https://github.com/maxjiang93/ugscnn and thier paper: Chiyu Max Jiang and Jingwei Huang and Karthik Kashinath and Prabhat and Philip Marcus and Matthias Niessner,Spherical CNNs on Unstructured Grids,International Conference on Learning Representations,2019,https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bkl-43C9FQ)
